description: >
  Reader for EDS maps and spectra saved by the EDAX TEAM
  software.
  An SPD file contains map data. The spectral information is 
  held in an SPC file with the same name, while the spatial 
  calibration is held in a related IPR file. If an SPD file 
  is loaded, the result will be a Hyperspy EDSSpectrum map, 
  and the calibration will be loaded from appropriate SPC 
  and IPR files (if available).  
  If an SPC file is loaded, the result will be a single  
  EDSSpectrum with no other files needed for calibration.
